# Semantic Search with Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch, is a powerful open-source search engine, that has been used for full-text search, analytics, and data visualization. Traditionally, Elasticsearch has been known for its ability to perform keyword-based search, where documents are matched based on exact or partial keyword matches. However, Elasticsearch has evolved to support semantic searchâ€”an approach that focuses on understanding the meaning behind words and phrases, rather than just matching keywords.

Semantic search in Elasticsearch enables more intuitive and context-aware search experiences, making it possible to find relevant information even when the exact keywords are not present in the query. This article will explore how semantic search can be implemented in Elasticsearch, its benefits, and practical use cases.

## Semantic Search
Semantic search is a technique that goes beyond traditional keyword-based search by considering the context, intent, and meaning of the search query. Unlike keyword search, which focuses on literal matches, semantic search understands the relationships between words and concepts, enabling more accurate and relevant search results.

For example, in a keyword-based search, a query like "laptop battery life" might return documents containing those exact words. However, a semantic search could return documents that discuss related concepts like "long-lasting laptops," "energy-efficient devices," or even "portable computers with extended battery life."

## How Elasticsearch Supports Semantic Search
Elasticsearch supports semantic search through a combination of techniques, including:

* Vector Representations: Using pre-trained models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to convert text into dense vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning.

* Similarity Scoring: Measuring the similarity between query vectors and document vectors to rank search results based on semantic relevance.

* Custom Analyzers: Creating custom tokenizers, filters, and analyzers that preprocess text data in ways that enhance semantic understanding.

* Integration with Machine Learning Models: Leveraging machine learning models that are integrated with Elasticsearch to perform tasks like entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and more

## Architecture - Semantic Search using Elastic Search

Two very important concepts in Elasticsearch are documents and indexes.

## Documents
A document is a collection of fields with their associated values. Each document is a JSON object that contains data in a structured format. For example, a document representing a book might contain fields like title, author, and publication date.

## Indexes
An index is a collection of documents that is stored in a highly optimized format designed to perform efficient searches. Indexes are similar to tables in a relational database, but they are more flexible and can store complex data structures.

To work with Elasticsearch, you need to organize your data into documents and then add all your documents to an index. This allows Elasticsearch to efficiently search and retrieve relevant documents based on the search queries.


# Implementing Semantic Search in Elasticsearch
## 1. Setting Up Elasticsearch
First, ensure that you have Elasticsearch up and running. You can use the official Docker image to set up Elasticsearch:
docker run -it \
    --rm \
    --name elasticsearch \
    -p 9200:9200 \
    -p 9300:9300 \
    -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
    -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
    docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.4.3
