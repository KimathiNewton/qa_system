# Vector Search
The Traditional keyword-based search systems, while effective in some scenarios, often fall short when dealing with complex data types such as images, audio, or even richly nuanced textual information. This is where vector search comes into play.Vector search offers a robust solution for finding the most relevant items based on their numerical representations. Vector search involves converting data (such as text, images, or other entities) into embeddings(numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space). These vectors capture the context of the data in addition to using keyword matching. The data points closer to each other in meaning, are placed closer to each other.
