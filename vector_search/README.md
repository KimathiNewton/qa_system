# Vector Search
The Traditional keyword-based search systems, while effective in some scenarios, often fall short when dealing with complex data types such as images, audio, or even richly nuanced textual information. This is where vector search comes into play.Vector search offers a robust solution for finding the most relevant items based on their numerical representations. Vector search involves converting data (such as text, images, or other entities) into embeddings(numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space). These vectors capture the context of the data in addition to using keyword matching. The data points closer to each other in meaning, are placed closer to each other.

# How Vector Search Works
## 1. Vector Representation
The first step in vector search is transforming data into vector representations (Embeddings). For textual data, techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, or more advanced transformer-based models like BERT are commonly used. These models pick patterns or representation of data and generate embeddings, preserving the semantic meaning.
For example, consider two sentences:

* "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
* "A fast, dark-colored fox leaps over a sleepy canine."
Despite using different words, these sentences convey similar meanings. Traditional keyword-based search might not recognize their similarity, but vector representations can capture the semantic essence, placing them close together in vector space.

## 2. Similarity Measurement
Once data is represented as vectors, the next step is to measure the similarity between these vectors, and the data points closer to each other in terms of meaning are placed closer to each other. Common metrics include:

* Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. A cosine similarity of 1 indicates identical vectors, while -1 indicates diametrically opposed vectors.
* Euclidean Distance: Measures the straight-line distance between two vectors in the vector space. Smaller distances indicate higher similarity.
* Dot Product: Measures the magnitude of the projection of one vector onto another. A higher dot product suggests greater similarity.

The choice of metric depends on the specific application and the nature of the data.These vectors are stored in a vector database or an index.

When a query is made, it is also converted into a vector.The query vector is compared with the indexed vectors using similarity measures like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.The most similar items are retrieved and presented as search results.
