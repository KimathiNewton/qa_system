# Evaluating Retrieval
## Why Evaluate Retrieval?
Evaluating retrieval performance is crucial to ensure that your search system returns relevant and accurate results. It helps in identifying areas for improvement and optimizing the search algorithms.

We will explore the importance of gold standard data sets and the role of evaluation metrics in determining the best approach for various datasets.

Here are the main points:

* Different Ways to Find Stuff: There are many methods to store and get data, like Min Search, Elastic Search, and Vector Search. Each has its own strengths, depending on what you need.
* Checking If It Works: To know which method is best, you need to test them using special techniques. This is like having a way to say, "For this search, these results are the best."
* Gold Standard Data: You need a "gold standard" or the best possible example of search results. This means knowing the best answers to common questions in advance.
* Measuring Performance: You use different scores to see how good the search results are. These scores help you understand if the search engine is showing the right results.
* Creating Test Data with LLMs: Sometimes, you can use Large Language Models (LLMs) to create these "best example" data sets if you don't have them already.
* Fine-Tuning: You can adjust different settings in tools like Elastic Search to improve the search results.***

## Gold Standard Data Sets
A critical aspect of evaluation is the use of gold standard data sets. These are ground truth data sets where the relevant documents for each query are known. For instance, given a query like "Can I still join the course?", the relevant documents would be pre-identified. This allows for a clear benchmark to assess the performance of different retrieval methods.

Generating Ground Truth Data
To check if a search system is working well, we need a set of good examples of questions and their correct answers. This helps us see if the system finds the right answers.

Typically, we have many queries and their corresponding relevant documents or one query has multiple relevant documents, helping to measure the accuracy of search results.

For practical purposes, we generate a data set where each query has one relevant document. This simplification helps in experimenting with and evaluating different retrieval techniques.
